3D CSS Sandbox Builder with React.

:warning: This is a WIP project, put together one evening for fun on [stream](https://twitch.tv/jh3yy).

## Notes...
- Abstract entity component where Tweakpane is used? Could base it off `props` where params are passed.

## Usage
To export a model to "CodePen". Copy the "OuterHTML" of the `.scene__wrapper` in DevTools for now and paste it in.
Then grab the CSS from [here](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/Pobawpa) and replace the `:root` CSS variables with whatver you have on your `html` tag.
